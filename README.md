# Licensing
I used the strongest copy-left license available on github to discourage corporations from using this code base <for now>. I am more than happy to make this available, sans licensing, for personal projects, and anyone following along in the video, for non corporate use. Additionally, I intend to make this available sans licensing to individuals wishing to publish their own games, but as of this writing am not sure how to do so so specifically.
  
For the time being, and especially since it is currently incomplete, the licensing will remain.
